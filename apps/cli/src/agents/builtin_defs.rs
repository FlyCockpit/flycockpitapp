//! Embedded default [`AgentDef`]s for the bundled cast.
//!
//! The agent prompt bodies live as `include_str!`-baked markdown in
//! [`crate::engine::builtin`]; this module wraps each with the
//! frontmatter (description / mode / tool surface) that the hardcoded
//! factory functions encode in Rust. Together they are the fallback
//! definition for a built-in when no on-disk override exists — and the
//! faithful source eject writes to `<config_dir>/agents/<name>.md`.
//!
//! In scope: every bundled agent **except the docs pipeline**. The docs
//! resolver/answerer are a fixed two-stage pipeline (GOALS §3a), never an
//! [`AgentDef`], so they are absent here.
//!
//! `model`/`temperature` are left `None` on the defaults: a built-in
//! inherits the session's active model + params unless the user sets an
//! override in the ejected file. `tools` is the explicit role surface so
//! the engine can rebuild the toolbox from an edited grant.
